        <h1>What We Do</h1>
        <p>Each Hack4Impact chapter chooses three to five projects per
           semester to work on with nonprofits. We work in small groups
            led by a project manager and technical lead to develop the
            application, taking into account our clientsâ€™ requirements
            and suggestions.
